This repository is a statistical regression calculator. 
Currently it has a linear regression calculator which takes in user data, and outputs the slope, y-intercept, and R-squared.
Future updates might include adding standard error or a graph of data with regression lines.
I might add nonlinear regression models include polynomial, exponential, and more.
